# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 31, 2025**

## Overview

User Agent Changer is a browser extension designed with privacy as its core principle. This privacy policy explains our data practices in clear terms: **we collect nothing, we store nothing, and we share nothing**.

## Data Collection

**We collect NO data whatsoever.**

This extension:
- Does NOT collect any personal information
- Does NOT collect any browsing history
- Does NOT collect any website URLs you visit
- Does NOT collect any usage statistics or analytics
- Does NOT collect any device information
- Does NOT track you in any way

## Data Storage

**We store NO data whatsoever.**

This extension:
- Does NOT store any data on remote servers (because we have none)
- Does NOT create user accounts or profiles
- Does NOT maintain any databases of user information
- Does NOT keep logs of your activity
- Does NOT save your browsing patterns

### Local Storage

The extension only uses your browser's local storage to save:
- Your user agent preferences (stored locally on YOUR device only)
- Your custom permanent spoofs configuration (stored locally on YOUR device only)

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is never transmitted anywhere
- Is never shared with anyone
- Is only accessible by the extension on your local browser
- Can be deleted at any time by removing the extension

## Data Sharing

**We share NO data whatsoever.**

This extension:
- Does NOT send data to any third parties
- Does NOT communicate with any external servers
- Does NOT have any backend infrastructure
- Does NOT integrate with any analytics services
- Does NOT share data with advertisers (we have no ads)
- Does NOT sell your data (we have no data to sell)

## How the Extension Works

The User Agent Changer extension operates entirely locally on your device:

1. **User Agent Modification**: When you browse the web, the extension intercepts browser requests and modifies the user agent string before the request is sent. This happens entirely within your browser.

2. **URL Checking**: The extension checks the current page URL against your locally stored permanent spoofs list to determine if a custom user agent should be applied. This check happens locally on your device.

3. **No External Communication**: The extension does NOT send the URLs you visit, the user agents you use, or any other information to any external server.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does NOT use any third-party services, including:
- No analytics services
- No crash reporting services
- No advertising networks
- No tracking pixels
- No external APIs
- No content delivery networks for data collection

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests certain browser permissions to function:

- **webRequest/webRequestBlocking**: To intercept and modify the user agent header before requests are sent
- **Storage**: To save your preferences locally on your device
- **Tabs**: To detect which URL is active and apply the appropriate user agent
- **All URLs (<all_urls>)**: To be able to modify user agent on any website you visit

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and NOT for data collection.

## Children's Privacy

Since we collect no data whatsoever, this extension is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

While our commitment to privacy will never change, we may update this policy to reflect:
- Changes in browser extension requirements
- Clarifications requested by users
- Updates to legal requirements

Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we collect and store no data about you:
- There is no data to access
- There is no data to delete
- There is no data to export
- There is no data to correct

However, you maintain complete control over your local settings and can:
- View your local preferences through the extension options page
- Modify your preferences at any time
- Delete all local data by removing the extension

## Open Source

This extension is open source, meaning anyone can review the code to verify that we do exactly what we claim: absolutely nothing with your data.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or the extension's data practices (or lack thereof), you can:
- Review the source code to verify our claims
- Open an issue on our repository
- Contact us through the extension's support channels

## Summary

**We are agnostic to your data. We collect nothing, store nothing remotely, and share nothing. The extension operates entirely locally on your device, simply modifying the user agent string for your browsing sessions. That's it. Nothing more.**

Your privacy is not a feature—it's our foundation.
